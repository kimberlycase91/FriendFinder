# FriendFinder
A compatibility-based 'friend finder' app that uses node.js and express.

## What does it do?
The user answers a few basic questions and is that matched with a Disney Princess. 

## How does it work?
The app uses node.js, express, and path to display a series of questions, all of which is formatted using materialize. 

The user provides a name and photo link, and answers 10 questions. The app then compares the results with each of the princess' results stored in the friends array, and finds the closest match.

It then displays the matching princess' name and gif in a modal.
